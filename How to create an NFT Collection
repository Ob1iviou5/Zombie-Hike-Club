There are Several different methods you cn use to create an NFT and its accompanying Metadata.

The Easiest way i have found to do is is:

Create your NFT on Photoshop or a similar program.
Split things into layers - Backgrounds, Body, Head, Torso, etc
Add your accessories
Ensure all layers are in the correct order with background being right at the bottom followed by everything else after. 
This will ensure that when your NFT is randomly generated, it won't show the background or another layer over the primary picture for instance.
Add all your layers into corresponding folders and name them.

# Once you have completed this process:
Now Go to Github and download the below:
https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine_ps_script

Once downladed, extract the file and remember where the file is stored.

Go back to Photoshop and go to File, Source, Browse.
Navigate to the File and press enter.
You will be presented with a few options.
Follow and add all details to these options, pressing OK each time.
Once this is complete, Photoshop will look like its frozen, but infact is creating your NFT's!

To check the progress, navigate to the folder and you should now see a build folder show up.
In there there will be 2 sub-folders.
Images and metadata. Both these will be required to create your Minting dApp and get your NFT's on Opensea and other marketplaces!.
